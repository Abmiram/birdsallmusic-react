            'My music education started when I was five years old with piano lessons from my grandmother. I attended concerts in my home town of Midland, MI where my father was concertmaster of the local orchestra.

I attended several summer sessions at prestigious Interlochen Center for the Arts in Michigan. I played the renowned Mendelssohn Violin Concerto with my high school orchestra.',
            'I studied under Fulbright scholar Alfio Pignotti at Eastern Michigan University, where I attained the rank of concertmaster, performed solo and chamber recitals, played with a Renaissance ensemble, and soloed with the orchestra, once as concerto competition winner, and once to rehearse the orchestra for a visiting soloist. I spent two summers as first violinist of the resident string quartet at Blue Lake music camp.',

While in Colorado I also did strolling violin gigs.',

I’ve performed solo guitar at coffee shops, weddings, and played one “rock” concert at an Art Fair!',
            'I use the Suzuki Method for Violin and Classical Guitar due to its elegance, learner friendliness, and gradual yet thorough features. I also teach traditional violin, and general guitar.'
